# Bachelor Thesis: Data Analysis

This repository contains data analysis scripts and measurement data used for the bachelor thesis:

**"An Integrated Pressure Sensor for Standardized Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography."**

Each Jupyter Notebook used for data analysis follows the naming format:  
`FSR_Test_<RM>.ipynb`

## Overview

The project investigates the behavior of a Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) under different conditions.  
It includes signal acquisition, statistical analysis, and evaluation of the sensorâ€™s performance across different circuit configurations.
