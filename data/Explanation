This folder contains raw data from all test rounds (TR) conducted for each reference resistor (RM).
Each dataset corresponds to a full TR consisting of individual 60-second recordings per weight.
The data is organized by:
- TR (Test Round): Sequential measurement sessions
- RM (Reference Resistor): Different resistor values (e.g., 2.2k立, 10k立, 47k立, 100k立)

These files are used for signal analysis.
